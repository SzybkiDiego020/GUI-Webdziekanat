3. Paste this URL (https://github.com/SzybkiDiego020/GUI-Webdziekanat.git) into the field and click clone. This step requires git to be installed. If it isn't, you can do it easily from the same window after an error appears.

4. Open the project and, after it loads, try to run it with the green arrow in the top right:

## Errors

If after trying to run the application a window popped up which requested a packet manager and an interpreter, please install NodeJS using [this tutorial](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows). Steps 1-3 are required.

Try filling in the information in the IntelliJ window which appears when running the application like so ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29752801/212468106-a960e125-2658-41ef-9962-bbc148d202dc.png)

If after that an error appears informing that 'ng' is not recognized as a command it may be required to add the npm and Angular CLI to the Path environmental variable. Follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37991556/ng-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/46066042#46066042)

At that point when trying to run the application a pop may appear in the bottom right corner of IntelliJ when trying to run the application:

Simply click the 'run npm install' button, wait for the needed packages to be installed, and try running the application again with the green arrow at the top. The program should compile which will be obvious from the message seen at the bottom:
